## [0:00 – 0:25] THE HOOK — Why This Matters

*Show: Landing page hero section*

> "Over 500 million smallholder farmers worldwide make critical decisions every day — when to plant, what to grow, how to treat a disease — with almost no access to expert advice.
>
> Language barriers, expensive consultants, and limited connectivity keep them in the dark.
>
> **AgriAgent changes that.**"

*Scroll down slowly to features section*

## [0:25 – 0:50] WHAT IT IS — The Architecture

*Show: Architecture diagram on landing page*

> "AgriAgent is a **multi-agent AI platform** built entirely with **Claude by Anthropic** — specifically **Opus 4.6** powering the orchestration layer.
>
> Five specialized agents work together — **Weather, Agronomy, Market, Alerts** — all coordinated by an intelligent **Orchestrator** that detects the farmer's language, understands their intent, and routes queries to the right agents **in parallel**.
>
> Every agent uses Claude's **tool-use capability** to fetch real-time data — weather forecasts, crop databases, market prices."

## [0:50 – 1:30] LIVE DEMO — The Chat

*Navigate to `/chat`*

> "Let me show you. I'm a farmer in Kaolack, Senegal."

*Type: "When should I plant peanuts in Kaolack this season?"*

> "I ask a simple question. Watch — the orchestrator calls the **Weather agent** and the **Agro agent** simultaneously. The response streams in **word by word** — combining weather forecasts with planting calendars, personalized to my exact location."

*Wait for response to stream*

> "But here's the thing — not everyone speaks English or French."

*Switch language to Wolof (WO button)*
*Type: "Kañ laa fàgg gerte ci Kaolack?"*

> "Same question, in **Wolof** — the native language of millions in Senegal. AgriAgent detects it automatically and responds **in Wolof**. Three languages — French, English, Wolof — across every page."

## [1:30 – 1:50] VOICE & VISION

*Click the microphone button*

> "Farmers can also use **voice input** — critical for communities with low literacy rates."

*Click the camera button (or show the diagnose feature)*

> "And with **Claude Vision**, they can snap a photo of a sick plant and get an instant diagnosis with treatment recommendations."

---

## [1:50 – 2:15] THE DASHBOARD & TOOLS

*Navigate to `/dashboard`*

> "The dashboard gives a **global view** — an interactive map covering **50+ cities** across 20 countries, with live weather and agricultural data."

*Navigate to `/parcelles`*

> "Farmers can manage their **fields** — track crops, record season history, get **AI-powered rotation advice**."

*Navigate to `/calendar`*

> "And plan with a **zone-specific agricultural calendar** — knowing exactly when to plant what, based on their agro-ecological zone."

---

## [2:15 – 2:40] SMS — REACHING EVERYONE

*Show the SMS section on landing page, or terminal where SMS was sent*

> "But the most powerful feature? **SMS**.
>
> A farmer with a basic phone — no internet, no smartphone — texts **METEO Kaolack**. AgriAgent processes it through the same multi-agent pipeline and replies with a weather forecast **in Wolof**, fitted into an SMS.
>
> Commands like **METEO**, **NJEG** for prices, **JEGGE** for disease help — simple, accessible, life-changing."

## [2:40 – 2:55] POLISH & UX

*Toggle dark mode, resize browser to mobile*

> "Everything is **mobile-first** and responsive. Dark and light themes. Smooth animations. An **onboarding tutorial** for first-time users. Even **gamification** to keep farmers engaged."

---

## [2:55 – 3:00] CLOSING

> "AgriAgent — **five AI agents, three languages, one mission**: putting expert agricultural intelligence into every farmer's hands.
